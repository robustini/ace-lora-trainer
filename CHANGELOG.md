# Changelog

## 2026-02-25 — Trigger Word in LoRA Config, Captioner Config, Start Menu

### LoRA/LoKR: Trigger Word Saved in Adapter JSON
- The **activation tag** (trigger word) used during training is now automatically saved inside the adapter config JSON (`adapter_config.json` for LoRA, `lokr_config.json` for LoKR)
- Fields added: `trigger_word` and `tag_position` (prepend/append/replace)
- Extracted from preprocessed `.pt` file metadata at training start
- Saved in all outputs: checkpoints, best model, and final model
- The trigger word is also displayed in the training log at startup

### Captioner: Config Save/Load System
- New **Config (Save / Load Settings)** accordion in the Captioner UI
- Saves and restores all UI fields: model paths, input/output folders, activation tag, max tokens, lyrics/CSV options
- Config stored as `captioner_config.json` (default in project root)
- **Auto-load on startup**: if config file exists, all fields are restored automatically

### Start Menu: Interactive Launcher
- `start.bat` now shows an interactive menu to choose between:
  1. LoRA Trainer
  2. Captioner
  3. Both (Trainer + Captioner)
- Command-line arguments still work (e.g. `start.bat --mode caption`) and skip the menu

---

## 2026-02-24 — Captioner Performance Optimization + Detokenizer Fix

### Captioner: Single-Pass Caption + Metadata (~30-40% Faster)
- **New method:** `caption_and_analyze()` — combines audio description and metadata extraction (key, time signature, genre) into a **single model inference** instead of two separate calls
- **Before:** 2 inference calls per file (caption @ 512 tokens + metadata @ 150 tokens)
- **After:** 1 inference call per file (combined @ 600 tokens)
- BPM and duration still computed via librosa (no model needed, unchanged)
- Metadata parsed from the combined output using the existing `_parse_key()`, `_parse_genre()`, and time signature regex parsers
- Caption text is cleanly separated from metadata lines via regex split
- Fallback: if metadata parsing fails from combined output, caption text is mined as before

### Captioner: Audio Prefetch with Threading (~10-20% Faster)
- **New:** `ThreadPoolExecutor` prefetches the next audio file with librosa while the GPU processes the current file
- Overlaps I/O-bound audio loading with GPU-bound inference — eliminates idle CPU time between files
- Safe: GIL released during I/O, no shared mutable state

### Captioner: Reduced CUDA Synchronization Overhead (~5-10% Faster)
- Removed `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` from `_run_inference()` and `_transcriber_inference()` — these were called after **every single inference**, causing 2-4 unnecessary CUDA sync points per file
- Per-file cleanup in the main processing loop is retained (prevents OOM on large batches)
- Tensor deletion (`del inputs`, `del output_ids`, `del new_tokens`) still runs after every inference to free GPU memory immediately

### Combined Speedup
- **Estimated total:** ~40-55% faster for caption + metadata (without lyrics)
- **Estimated total:** ~25-35% faster for full pipeline (with lyrics — lyrics inference unchanged)
- Example: 50-file dataset previously ~5min → now ~3min (caption + metadata only)

### Handler: Detokenizer Float32 Overflow Fix
- **Bug:** On long audio sequences, the detokenizer's self-attention Q·K dot products could exceed bfloat16 range (65504), producing Inf → NaN that propagated through the entire ODE solver
- **Fix:** Detokenizer now runs in float32 temporarily during `_decode_audio_codes()`, then casts back to the model's dtype
- Added diagnostic logging for quantized output and detokenizer output (shape, min/max, NaN/Inf detection)

### Handler: Pre-Generation Tensor Diagnostics
- New diagnostic checkpoint before ODE generation: logs shape, dtype, min/max, mean/std, NaN/Inf status for all key tensors (src_latents, silence_latent, chunk_mask, text_hidden_states, precomputed_lm_hints_25Hz)
- Writes full diagnostics to `generation_diagnostics.json` for offline analysis

## 2026-02-23 — Upstream Sync: ACE-Step 1.5 Improvements

### Critical Bug Fixes (from upstream PRs)
- **torch.compile + PEFT crash guard (PR #640):** Auto-detects PEFT LoRA adapters and skips `torch.compile` to prevent crashes on PyTorch ≥2.7 + CUDA. Previously, enabling torch.compile with LoRA active would cause hard crashes
- **Symlink resolution in dataset paths (PR #648):** Uses `os.path.realpath()` instead of `os.path.normpath()` when resolving tensor file paths. Prevents false rejections when datasets are stored on symlinked/junction paths

### Two-Pass Preprocessing (Low VRAM)
- **New method:** `DatasetBuilder.preprocess_two_pass()` splits preprocessing into two sequential passes for GPUs with 8-12GB VRAM
  - **Pass 1 (~3GB):** VAE + Text Encoder — encodes audio to latents, tokenizes text/lyrics, saves intermediate `.tmp.pt` files
  - **Pass 2 (~6GB):** DIT Encoder — loads intermediates, runs model.encoder, saves final `.pt` files
  - Automatically offloads VAE + Text Encoder to CPU between passes
  - Temporary files cleaned up after completion
- **Why:** The single-pass pipeline requires all models simultaneously (~10-12GB). Two-pass mode enables preprocessing on 8GB GPUs

### GPU Monitoring
- **New module:** `acestep/training/gpu_monitor.py` with `GPUMonitor` class
  - Background threaded monitoring with configurable poll interval
  - VRAM alert threshold (default 92%) with callback support
  - Snapshot history with summary statistics (peak, average, utilization)
  - Auto-starts during Fabric training, logs summary at completion
- **New helpers:** `detect_gpu()` returns GPU name/driver/compute cap, `get_available_vram_mb()` returns free VRAM

### Cosine Restarts Scheduler
- **New scheduler option:** `scheduler_type = "cosine_restarts"` — cosine annealing with warm restarts
  - Periodically resets learning rate, which can help escape local minima on small LoRA datasets
  - First cycle = 1/4 of remaining steps, subsequent cycles double (T_mult=2)
  - Minimum LR = 1% of initial LR (same as cosine)

### VRAM Presets (Externalized JSON)
- **New directory:** `acestep/training/presets/` with 7 JSON preset files:
  - `vram_8gb.json` — rank 16, 8-bit optimizer, encoder offloading
  - `vram_12gb.json` — rank 32, 8-bit optimizer, encoder offloading
  - `vram_16gb.json` — rank 64, standard optimizer
  - `vram_24gb_plus.json` — rank 128, batch size 2
  - `recommended.json` — balanced defaults matching upstream
  - `quick_test.json` — rank 16, 10 epochs, fast iteration
  - `high_quality.json` — rank 128, 1000 epochs, min-SNR weighting
- **New APIs:** `list_presets()`, `load_preset(name)`, `apply_preset(config, lora_config, name)`, `auto_select_preset()` (auto-detects GPU and picks best preset)

### MLX Backend (Apple Silicon)
- **New module:** `acestep/mlx/` with infrastructure for Apple Silicon acceleration (2-3x faster than MPS)
  - `__init__.py` — `is_mlx_available()` detection (macOS + arm64 + mlx import)
  - `convert.py` — weight conversion from PyTorch to MLX format (Conv1d axis swaps, weight_norm fusion, rotary embedding skipping)
  - `engine.py` — `MLXInferenceEngine` class with model loading, weight caching, and generation API surface
  - Weight conversion and caching is fully implemented; full DiT/VAE model porting is in progress

### Data Preparation Scripts (Captioner)
- **WhisperTranscriber** — Transcribe lyrics via OpenAI Whisper API with word-level timestamps and intelligent line breaking for CJK/Latin scripts. Batch directory processing with sidecar `.lyrics.txt` output
- **ElevenLabsTranscriber** — Transcribe lyrics via ElevenLabs Scribe API. Same word-level timestamp approach as Whisper, filters for word-type entries only
- **GeminiCaptioner** — Full audio analysis via Google Gemini API. Generates caption, lyrics, genre, BPM, key, time signature in structured JSON. Supports large files (>20MB) via file upload API. Batch processing with sidecar `.caption.txt` and `.lyrics.txt` files

## 2026-02-22b — Min-SNR Loss Weighting, NaN Detection, Audio Normalization

### Min-SNR Loss Weighting (from Side-Step / Hang et al. 2023)
- **New option:** `loss_weighting = "min_snr"` in TrainingConfig — applies Min-SNR-gamma weighting to per-timestep loss
- **How it works:** Computes `SNR(t) = (1-t)^2 / t^2` for flow-matching timesteps, then weights loss by `clamp(SNR, max=gamma) / SNR`. Easy (high-SNR, low-t) timesteps contribute less, while noisy timesteps are capped at `gamma`
- **Configurable:** `snr_gamma` parameter (default 5.0, matching the paper) controls the clamping value
- **UI:** New "Loss Weighting" dropdown and "SNR Gamma" slider in the Advanced: Timestep & CFG section
- **Compatible with:** Both Fabric and basic training loops

### NaN / Inf Detection & Auto-Halt
- **New feature:** Automatically detects NaN or Infinity losses during training and halts after N consecutive bad batches
- **Configurable:** `nan_detection_max` parameter (default 10, 0=disabled). Set via "NaN Halt Threshold" in the UI
- **Diagnostics:** When training halts, prints detailed diagnostics: consecutive count, total count, last epoch/batch, possible causes (LR too high, gradient explosion, data corruption, fp16 overflow)
- **Graceful recovery:** Bad batches are skipped (gradients zeroed), training continues if within threshold. Counter resets on any good batch
- **Both loops:** Implemented in both Fabric and basic (non-Fabric) training loops

### Audio Normalization During Preprocessing
- **New option:** Normalize audio loudness before VAE encoding during tensor preprocessing
- **Modes:**
  - `none` (default) — raw audio as-is
  - `peak` — peak-normalize to -1.0 dBFS (loudest sample = 1.0)
  - `lufs` — loudness-normalize to -14 LUFS (broadcast standard)
  - `peak_lufs` — both: peak-normalize first, then LUFS-normalize
- **Why:** Inconsistent volume levels across training samples can cause the model to learn volume artifacts instead of musical features. Normalizing audio before encoding ensures consistent latent representations
- **UI:** New "Audio Normalization" dropdown in the preprocessing section
- **Anti-clipping:** LUFS normalization includes automatic clip protection (peaks are capped at 1.0)
- **Manifest:** Normalization mode is recorded in the manifest.json `preprocessing` section for reproducibility

---

## 2026-02-22 — Side-Step Interop, Language Override, Bug Fixes

### Side-Step Config Interoperability
- **Import/export** training configs compatible with [Side-Step](https://github.com/koda-dernet/Side-Step) — the complementary LoRA training toolkit by [@koda-dernet](https://github.com/koda-dernet)
- **Import:** Load any Side-Step preset JSON (recommended, vram_8gb, high_quality, etc.) and automatically map all 17 training parameters to the ace-lora-trainer UI
- **Export:** Save current training settings as a Side-Step-compatible preset JSON that works directly in Side-Step's `--preset` flag
- **Auto-detection:** Import function automatically identifies Side-Step presets vs ace-lora-trainer profiles
- **Bidirectional field mapping:** Handles naming differences (e.g., `rank` vs `lora_rank`, `adamw8bit` vs `AdamW 8-bit`, `cfg_ratio` vs `cfg_dropout_prob`)
- **New UI section:** "Side-Step Interop" panel inside the Profiles accordion with browse/import/export buttons

### Language Override for AI Auto-Labeling
- **New dropdown** in the auto-label section: choose a specific language instead of relying on the 5Hz LM model's auto-detection (which was often random/incorrect for non-English lyrics)
- **40 languages supported:** English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Hindi, and 28 more
- **How it works:** The LLM still runs full auto-detection for captions/BPM/key/etc., then the detected language is overridden with the user's selection on all non-instrumental samples
- **Full stack:** UI dropdown, `label_sample()` and `label_all_samples()` in dataset_builder, API server endpoint

### Fix: Training won't start — tensor files not found (Issue #7)
- **Bug:** After preprocessing, training failed with "0 samples cached in RAM" because the manifest stored absolute paths. Moving the tensor directory or running from a different location broke all path references
- **Root cause:** `dataset_builder.py` saved full absolute paths (e.g., `D:\datasets\tensor.pt`) in `manifest.json`. The data module loader expected these exact paths to exist
- **Fix (manifest writer):** Now stores relative paths (just filenames) in both `samples` and `sample_details` arrays for full portability
- **Fix (manifest reader):** Resolves relative paths against the tensor directory. Added fallback: if an absolute path doesn't exist, tries to find the file by basename in the tensor directory — handles legacy manifests with absolute paths

### Fix: Sample inference device mismatch during training (Issue #2 follow-up)
- **Bug:** `RuntimeError: Expected all tensors to be on the same device, but found at least two devices, cuda:0 and cpu!` when sample inference was enabled with encoder offloading
- **Root cause:** With encoder offloading active, VAE/text_encoder/encoder are on CPU during training. `generate_music()` needs them on GPU but nothing moved them back
- **Fix:** Before generating samples, explicitly move `vae`, `text_encoder`, and `encoder` to the training device (GPU). After generation, the existing cleanup code moves them back to CPU if offloading is enabled

---

## 2026-02-18a — Sample Inference During Training + Fix Gradient Checkpointing Crash

### Auto sample inference during training (Issue #2)
- **New feature:** Generate test audio at regular epoch intervals so you can hear how the model evolves during training — loss curves alone can't tell you if the model sounds good
- **Configurable:** Enable/disable toggle, sample every N epochs, prompt, lyrics, BPM, key, time signature, duration, seed
- **Multiple LoRA strengths:** Comma-separated (e.g., "0.5, 1.0, 1.5") — generates one sample per strength per interval
- **Inference params:** Steps, guidance scale, shift (0 = use training config defaults)
- **VRAM-safe:** Graceful OOM handling — if sample generation fails due to VRAM, logs a warning and continues training
- **Output:** Saved to `<output_dir>/samples/epoch_<N>/strength_<S>.wav`
- **New UI section:** "🎵 Sample Inference During Training" accordion in the training tab

### Fix gradient checkpointing crash (Issue #3)
- **Bug:** Training crashed immediately with `RuntimeError: element 0 of tensors does not require grad and does not have a grad_fn` when gradient checkpointing was enabled
- **Root cause:** PEFT + gradient checkpointing requires `enable_input_require_grads()` on the PEFT model before `gradient_checkpointing_enable()`. Without it, checkpointed layers see inputs without `requires_grad=True` and produce a loss with no grad_fn
- **Fix:** Added `enable_input_require_grads()` call before gradient checkpointing is enabled

---

## 2026-02-17a — Fix Captioner OOM, Key/Scale, and Checkpoint Path

### Fix captioner OOM on 32GB GPUs
- **Bug:** Batch captioning (60+ files) caused CUDA OOM even on 32GB GPUs (5090). The `_run_inference()` and `_transcriber_inference()` methods accumulated input tensors and KV-cache across multiple calls without freeing GPU memory
- **Fix:** Added `try/finally` cleanup in both inference methods — `inputs`, `output_ids`, and `new_tokens` are now `del`'d and `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` runs after **every single inference call**, not just between files
- **Fix:** `transcribe_lyrics()` now accepts pre-loaded `audio_array` to avoid redundant audio reloading during batch processing

### Fix key/scale extraction still failing
- **Bug:** Key extraction returned empty for most files despite genre working fine
- **Fix:** Improved metadata prompt to be more natural (Qwen responds better to questions than rigid format instructions)
- **Fix:** Expanded `_parse_key()` with 7 cascading regex patterns including: "is D minor", "is in C# major", "in the key of A minor", shorthand "Dm"/"Am", standalone note+mode, and key-related word proximity matching
- **Fix:** Added unicode sharp/flat normalization (♯→#, ♭→b) before regex matching
- **Fix:** Improved time signature fallback to match "4/4", "3/4" anywhere in text

### Fix checkpoint path — models re-downloaded despite custom directory
- **Bug:** When users pointed to an existing ACE-Step checkpoints folder (e.g., their main ACE-Step install), the trainer ignored it and re-downloaded ~20GB of models to its own `./checkpoints` directory
- **Root cause:** `initialize_service()` always derived `checkpoint_dir` from `_get_project_root()` before checking if models exist. The custom dir override only happened AFTER the download checks had already run
- **Fix:** Added `custom_checkpoint_dir` parameter to `initialize_service()` — now checks custom dir for models BEFORE falling back to download. LLM handler also searches both custom and default directories

---

## 2026-02-16c — Fix Auto-Label + Split Audio

### Fix auto-label "Model not initialized" after LLM download
- **Bug:** After downloading & loading the LLM, clicking "Auto-Label All" failed with "Failed to convert audio to codes: Model not initialized" because `convert_src_audio_to_codes()` needs the VAE (loaded only with lazy init, not at startup)
- **Fix:** `auto_label_samples()` now calls `dit_handler.ensure_models_loaded()` to auto-load VAE + text encoder before labeling — same pattern as preprocessing

### Fix split audio `[WinError 2]` — ffmpeg not found
- **Bug:** Split audio used `pydub.AudioSegment` which requires `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` binaries on the system PATH
- **Fix:** Replaced `pydub` with `torchaudio` + `soundfile` (both already dependencies) — no external binary needed

---

## 2026-02-16b — Captioner: Fix OOM + Missing Key/Genre

### Fix OOM on large batches (60+ files)
- Audio is now loaded **once per file** and reused for caption, metadata, and lyrics (was loading 2-3x)
- Added `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` between files to release KV cache and prevent VRAM fragmentation
- Reduces peak VRAM usage significantly for batch captioning

### Fix missing Key Scale and Genre
- Improved metadata extraction prompt for more reliable structured output from Qwen
- Extracted key/genre parsing into reusable `_parse_key()` / `_parse_genre()` static methods
- Added **caption text mining** as fallback: if the structured metadata call fails to extract key or genre, the caption description is searched (e.g., "electronic pop track in D minor")
- Expanded genre keyword list with compound genres (synth-pop, trip-hop, drum and bass, etc.)
- Key parser now handles more formats: "in D minor", "the key of A", shorthand "Dm", note-only "D"

---

## 2026-02-16a — Optional LLM Download + Fix `--mode both`

### Optional LLM Download for Auto-Labeling
The LLM for AI auto-labeling is now fully optional with on-demand download.

- Added **"Download & Enable AI Labeling (~3.5 GB)"** button in the Dataset tab's auto-label section
- LLM is no longer required at startup — users can download it when needed
- Auto-label error message now directs users to either download the LLM or use CSV/manual labeling
- Info box recommends standalone captioning tools for higher quality captions (importable via CSV)

### Fix `--mode both` captioner not starting
- **Bug:** `python launch.py --mode both` launched the captioner UI in a daemon thread, which could silently crash due to Gradio event loop conflicts between two apps in the same process
- **Fix:** Captioner now runs as a **separate subprocess**, which isolates each Gradio app's event loop and makes both UIs reliable. The captioner process is automatically terminated when the training UI exits

---

## 2026-02-15f — Fix Preprocessing Crash (VAE not loaded)

**Bug:** Preprocessing failed with `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'dtype'` because lazy loading only loaded the DiT model at initialization, leaving VAE and text encoder as `None`. Preprocessing requires both.

**Fix:**
- `lora_training_ui.py`: `preprocess_dataset()` now calls `dit_handler.ensure_models_loaded()` before preprocessing to auto-load VAE + text encoder if needed
- `dataset_builder.py`: Added explicit guard checks for `vae is None` and `text_encoder is None` with clear error messages instead of cryptic `AttributeError`

Fixes [#1](https://github.com/Estylon/ace-lora-trainer/issues/1).

---

## 2026-02-15e — Adapter-Aware GPU Presets (LoRA vs LoKr)

GPU presets now differentiate between LoRA and LoKr training parameters.

**Key LoKr preset differences vs LoRA:**
- **Learning rate:** 3e-4 (vs 1e-4) — Kronecker factorization benefits from higher LR
- **Gradient accumulation:** 4-8x (vs 1-2x) — smooths noisy gradients from smaller effective batch
- **Epochs:** 500 (vs 800-1000) — LoKr converges faster
- **Optimizer:** AdamW (vs Prodigy) — standard optimizer, more predictable with LoKr
- **Dropout:** 0.0 (vs 0.1) — LoKr already has implicit regularization via Kronecker structure
- **Early stop patience:** 50 (vs 80) — faster convergence = detect plateau earlier
- **Best-model warmup:** 100 (vs 200) — start tracking best MA5 sooner

**How it works:**
- Selecting a GPU preset applies the LoRA or LoKr sub-preset based on the current Adapter Type selection
- Switching Adapter Type (LoRA↔LoKr) while a preset is active automatically re-applies the correct sub-preset
- LoKr-specific fields (Factor, Linear Dim, Linear Alpha, Decompose Both, Tucker, Dropout) are also set by presets
- "Custom" preset still leaves everything unchanged

### Other fixes
- **GPU VRAM status not showing** — Fixed `total_mem` → `total_memory` typo in `get_vram_info()`
- **Final model uses best MA5** — Training completion now copies the best MA5 checkpoint as `final/` instead of saving last-epoch weights

---

## 2026-02-15c — Custom Checkpoints Folder

Added the ability to select a custom folder for model checkpoints in the Service tab.

- **New "Checkpoints Folder" field** — Textbox + browse button (`📂`) above the model dropdown. Point it to any folder containing `acestep-v15-*` model directories.
- **Auto-refresh** — Changing the folder automatically rescans and updates the Model Checkpoint dropdown.
- **Refresh button** now also respects the custom folder when rescanning.
- **`initialize_service()`** — Resolves the selected model from the custom folder and overrides the handler's checkpoint dir so `_load_dit()` finds it correctly.
- Leave the field empty to use the default `checkpoints/` locations as before.

---

## 2026-02-15b — LoKr Training Speed Fix + lycoris-lora Required

### Critical Fix: LoKr Training 10-50x Slower Than LoRA

**Root cause:** The LyCORIS library creates adapter parameters on **CPU** regardless of where the decoder lives (GPU). Our code never explicitly relocated these parameters to GPU after injection. Every forward pass during LoKr training triggered CPU→GPU data transfers, making training catastrophically slow (~300s/epoch for 32 samples vs ~10s for LoRA).

**How we found it:** The upstream [ACE-Step 1.5](https://github.com/ace-step/ACE-Step-1.5) V2 training module (`training_v2/fixed_lora_module.py`) has an explicit `.to(self.device)` call after LoKr injection that our V1-based trainer was missing.

**Files changed:**
- **`acestep/training/lokr_utils.py`** — After `lycoris_net.apply_to()`, explicitly move `lycoris_net` and `model.decoder` to the decoder's device so all parameters (base + adapter) are co-located before training begins.
- **`acestep/training/trainer.py`** — In both `_train_with_fabric()` and `_train_basic()`, ensure `lycoris_net` params match training dtype and device before Fabric setup / optimizer creation. Removed the redundant `fabric.setup_module(decoder)` call that was double-wrapping the decoder.

### lycoris-lora Now a Required Dependency

- `requirements.txt` — Changed `lycoris-lora>=2.0.0` from optional (commented) to required. LoKr is a first-class adapter type alongside LoRA.

---

## 2026-02-15 — Lazy/On-Demand Model Loading

Reduced idle VRAM usage and startup time by loading models only when needed.

- **`initialize_service(lazy=True)`** — new mode that stores config and downloads models but defers weight loading. The server/UI is ready immediately.
- **`ensure_models_loaded()`** — thread-safe lazy loader that loads all models (DiT + VAE + text encoder) on first generation request. Uses double-check locking for safe concurrent access.
- **`ensure_dit_loaded()`** — loads only the DiT model for training workflows, skipping VAE and text encoder (~3GB VRAM saved).
- **Training UI** now calls `ensure_dit_loaded()` instead of loading all models — VAE and text encoder are never used during training.
- **`generate_music()`** auto-triggers `ensure_models_loaded()` if models aren't loaded yet.
- **Pinokio API server** uses lazy init for all DiT handlers (primary + secondary + tertiary) — server starts in <5s instead of 30-120s. `/health` endpoint now reports `models_loaded` and `llm_loaded` status.

---

## 2026-02-14b — LoKr Support, Upstream Optimizations & Bug Fixes

### LoKr (Low-Rank Kronecker) Training Support

Added full LoKr adapter training as an alternative to LoRA, powered by the [LyCORIS](https://github.com/KohakuBlueleaf/LyCORIS) library.

**New files:**
- `acestep/training/lokr_utils.py` — LoKr injection, save/load/merge utilities
- `acestep/training/configs.py` — New `LoKRConfig` dataclass

**What changed:**
- **Training UI** — New "Adapter Type" radio selector (LoRA / LoKr) with conditional parameter panels. LoKr settings: Factor (-1 = auto), Linear Dim (10000 = auto), Linear Alpha, Decompose Both, Use Tucker, Dropout.
- **Trainer** — `PreprocessedLoRAModule` and `LoRATrainer` now branch on `adapter_type` for injection, save, load, merge, gradient clipping, and Fabric setup. The training loop (flow matching, timestep sampling, CFG dropout) is identical for both adapters.
- **Merge tab** — Auto-detects adapter type from checkpoint files (`adapter_config.json` = PEFT LoRA, `lokr_config.json` = LyCORIS LoKr).
- **Inference loader** (`handler.py`) — `load_lora()` auto-detects and loads both LoRA (PEFT) and LoKr (LyCORIS) adapters. `unload_lora()` cleans up both adapter types.

**LoKr vs LoRA:**
- LoKr uses Kronecker product factorization — often more parameter-efficient at similar expressiveness
- LoKr is experimental and requires `lycoris-lora>=2.0.0` (optional dependency, commented in `requirements.txt`)
- LoRA remains the default and recommended option

### Upstream ACE-Step 1.5 Optimizations Integrated

Integrated key improvements from the upstream [ACE-Step 1.5](https://github.com/ace-step/ACE-Step-1.5) repository:

**PR #499 — LoRA Memory Bloat Fix (70% VRAM reduction on load/unload)**
- Replaced `copy.deepcopy(model.decoder)` with CPU `state_dict()` backup for the base decoder
- Loading a LoRA/LoKr adapter no longer doubles VRAM usage (~10-15GB saved)
- Unloading restores from CPU state_dict + calls `torch.cuda.empty_cache()`
- VRAM usage is logged before/after load and unload operations

**PR #554 — Opus and AAC Output Formats**
- `AudioSaver` now supports `opus` and `aac` formats via ffmpeg backend
- Added to format validation, extension handling, and convert functions
- Gradio UI dropdown updated with new format options

**PR #492 — Batch LLM Load/Offload Optimization**
- `_load_model_context()` made reentrant: if model is already on GPU, nested calls are no-ops
- Batch loop in `_run_pt()` wrapped in a single `_load_model_context()` so the LLM loads once and offloads once per batch (was N loads + N offloads before)

**PR #493 — Phase-Aware max_new_tokens / Progress Bar Fix**
- New `_compute_max_new_tokens()` method replaces inline calculations
- In "codes" phase, buffer is +10 tokens (not +500) since constrained decoder forces exact EOS
- Fixes progress bar appearing to stall at ~66% during codes generation

### Bug Fix: Checkpoint Discovery for Pinokio Layout

- `get_checkpoints_dir()` now searches both `ACE-Step-1.5/checkpoints/` and `checkpoints/` directories
- New `_get_all_checkpoint_dirs()` scans all known checkpoint locations with deduplication
- New `resolve_checkpoint_path()` resolves checkpoint names to full paths across all directories
- Fixes empty "Model Checkpoint" dropdown when running under Pinokio (where base models are symlinked to `ACE-Step-1.5/checkpoints/`, not `checkpoints/`)

## 2026-02-14 — Training Quality Fix: Corrected Timestep Sampling & CFG Dropout

### Background — How We Found These Issues

While reviewing the upstream [ACE-Step 1.5 repository](https://github.com/ace-step/ACE-Step-1.5), we noticed that the **Side-Step training v2** module ([PR #478](https://github.com/ace-step/ACE-Step-1.5/pull/478) by [@koda-dernet](https://github.com/koda-dernet)) was merged on Feb 13. This module introduced a completely new `acestep/training_v2/` directory with corrected training algorithms.

After a thorough analysis comparing our `acestep/training/trainer.py` (v1) against the new `trainer_fixed.py` (v2), we identified **4 critical correctness issues** in our training pipeline that were degrading LoRA quality. These issues existed in the original training code that we inherited, not in our own additions.

The key insight from Side-Step's code is that the original v1 trainer used timestep sampling and CFG dropout strategies designed for **inference**, not for **LoRA training**. The v2 trainer corrects these to match the model's actual **pre-training** distribution.

### Critical Fix 1: Timestep Sampling — Discrete → Logit-Normal

**Problem:** Our trainer (v1) used a fixed set of 8 discrete timesteps for turbo models, sampled uniformly from `[1.0, 0.95, 0.9, 0.83, 0.75, 0.64, 0.5, 0.3]`. This schedule was designed for the turbo model's 8-step **inference** pipeline, not for training.

**Why it matters:** During pre-training, ACE-Step uses a **logit-normal distribution** (`t = sigmoid(N(μ, σ))` with `μ=-0.4, σ=1.0`) to sample timesteps. By training LoRA with only 8 discrete timesteps, we were teaching the model to only denoise at those specific noise levels, creating a distribution mismatch with the full continuous spectrum the model actually uses.

**Fix:** Replaced `sample_discrete_timestep()` and `sample_continuous_timestep()` with a single `sample_logit_normal_timestep()` that faithfully reproduces the model's own `sample_t_r()` function (from `modeling_acestep_v15_turbo.py` lines 169-194). This is used for **all** model variants (turbo and base).

### Critical Fix 2: CFG Dropout — Zeroed Embeddings → Learned Null Embedding

**Problem:** When applying classifier-free guidance (CFG) dropout during training, our v1 code **zeroed out** the encoder hidden states for dropped samples. Additionally, CFG dropout was only applied to base models, not turbo.

**Why it matters:** The model was pre-trained with a specific **learned null/unconditional embedding** (`model.null_condition_emb`), not zero vectors. Zeroing out embeddings creates an artificial input the model never saw during pre-training, producing incorrect gradient signals. Furthermore, the original pre-training applied CFG dropout to all model variants, not just base.

**Fix:** New `apply_cfg_dropout()` function that:
1. Uses `model.null_condition_emb` (the model's learned unconditional embedding) instead of zeros
2. Is applied to **all model types** (turbo + base), matching pre-training behavior
3. Default dropout probability changed from 0.1 to 0.15 (matching v2 defaults)

**Source:** `acestep/training_v2/timestep_sampling.py:apply_cfg_dropout()` and `trainer_fixed.py` lines referencing `model.null_condition_emb` in [ACE-Step 1.5 PR #478](https://github.com/ace-step/ACE-Step-1.5/pull/478)

### Critical Fix 3: Loss Reporting — Corrected Arithmetic

**Problem:** When gradient accumulation > 1, our reported loss values were divided by `gradient_accumulation_steps` (because each micro-batch loss is already divided by G before backward). The logged/displayed loss was `1/G` of the actual per-sample loss.

**Fix:** Corrected loss computation: `avg_loss = accumulated_loss * gradient_accumulation_steps / accumulation_step` to report the true per-sample loss value.

**Note:** If you compare loss curves from before and after this fix, post-fix values will appear higher by a factor of G. The underlying training is identical — only the reported number changed.

### Critical Fix 4: End-of-Epoch Remainder Flushing

**Problem:** When the number of batches per epoch is not evenly divisible by `gradient_accumulation_steps`, the leftover accumulated gradients at the end of each epoch were silently dropped. For example, with 17 songs and gradient_accumulation=4, the last 1 sample's gradients were thrown away every epoch.

**Fix:** Added explicit remainder flushing at epoch boundaries — if there are accumulated gradients when the epoch ends, an optimizer step is performed to use them.

### New UI Parameters

- **Timestep μ (mu)** — Logit-normal mean. Default -0.4 (bias toward cleaner data, matching pre-training). Available in Advanced accordion.
- **Timestep σ (sigma)** — Logit-normal standard deviation. Default 1.0. Available in Advanced accordion.
- **CFG Dropout** — Moved from base-model-only to a general parameter. Default 0.15 (15%). Now applies to all model types.

### Other Improvements
- **Per-epoch VRAM cache clearing** — Calls `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` at end of each epoch to reduce VRAM fragmentation
- Training start message now shows timestep distribution parameters: `logit-normal(μ=-0.4, σ=1.0)`

### What We Kept (Our Features Not in v2)
The v2 Side-Step trainer removes several features that we intentionally keep because they improve the training experience:
- ✅ Early stopping with MA5 smoothed loss tracking
- ✅ Auto-save best model after warmup period
- ✅ torch.compile support
- ✅ VRAM monitor and pre-training GPU check
- ✅ GPU presets for different hardware tiers

## 2026-02-13 — Initial Release

First public release of the ACE-Step LoRA Trainer + Captioner as a standalone project, separated from the Pinokio launcher.

### Repository Setup
- **Initial commit** — Extracted core training modules (`acestep/training/`), model handler, LLM inference, captioner, and Gradio UIs from the Pinokio-based ACE-Step project into a self-contained standalone repository
- 20,000+ lines of code across 26 files
- Published to GitHub at `github.com/Estylon/ace-lora-trainer`

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed ACESTEP_PATH pointing to non-existent directory** — Was looking for `ACE-Step-1.5/` which doesn't exist in standalone repo. Changed to repo root so checkpoint discovery works correctly
- **Fixed captioner/transcriber hardcoded Pinokio paths** — Changed `DEFAULT_MODEL_PATH` from `D:/pinokio/drive/.../acestep-captioner` to HuggingFace model ID `ACE-Step/acestep-captioner` so models auto-download on first use
- **Fixed captioner rejecting HuggingFace model IDs** — `os.path.exists()` was blocking valid HF model IDs like `ACE-Step/acestep-captioner`. Added HF ID detection (org/model format) to allow them through to `from_pretrained()`
- **Fixed torchao breaking Windows installs** — torchao has no Windows wheels and requires `torch.compile` + Triton (neither available on Windows). Made it Linux-only in `requirements.txt` since it's only needed for INT8/FP8 quantization, not LoRA training
- **Fixed RTX 3060/4060 GPU preset** — Changed optimizer from `adamw8bit` to `adafactor` and scheduler from `cosine` to `constant_with_warmup`. Adafactor uses near-zero optimizer state memory, making it viable for 8GB VRAM where AdamW 8-bit still OOMs

### Dependency Fixes
- Added missing `pydub` (audio splitting) and `diskcache` (caching) to requirements
- Removed unused `xxhash` dependency
- Added missing `acestep/genres_vocab.txt` (178K genre vocabulary file needed for caption generation)
- Updated `.gitignore` with `.cache/`, `lora_projects/`, `datasets/*.json`

### New Features

#### Install & Launch Scripts
- **`install.bat`** (Windows) and **`install.sh`** (Linux/Mac) — One-click installer that creates virtual environment, installs all dependencies via `uv pip` (with pip fallback), and verifies critical packages (PyTorch, PEFT, Lightning, Gradio, Prodigy, Transformers)
- **`start.bat`** (Windows) and **`start.sh`** (Linux/Mac) — One-click launcher that activates venv and runs the trainer
- **Environment checks in `launch.py`** — Detects if running without a virtual environment or with missing packages (especially PEFT) and warns before proceeding. This prevents the silent failure where training falls back to full fine-tuning without LoRA (~35x larger checkpoints, much slower)

#### VRAM Monitor
- **Real-time GPU status** in the Training tab showing GPU name, VRAM used/free/total with color-coded indicator (green/yellow/red)
- **Other process detection** — Uses `nvidia-smi` to list other processes occupying the GPU (e.g., ACE-Step API) with their VRAM usage
- **Pre-training VRAM check** — When clicking "Start Training", automatically checks for insufficient free VRAM and warns about other GPU processes
- **Refresh button** for manual VRAM status updates

### Documentation
- **`TRAINING_GUIDE.md`** — Comprehensive ~950-line training guide covering complete workflow (7 steps from captioning to merge), all parameters with defaults/ranges/explanations, all 4 GPU presets with full parameter tables, optimizer/scheduler comparison tables, disk space requirements, security audit section, and troubleshooting guide
- **`LICENSE`** — Apache License 2.0
- **`README.md`** — Updated with accurate GPU preset table (including scheduler column), auto-download model documentation, simplified install instructions using new scripts, and links to training guide

### Architecture Notes
The standalone trainer is **100% self-sufficient** — all model loading and inference happens in-process via PyTorch/HuggingFace Transformers. No external API server is required. The Gradio UI handles everything: model initialization, dataset building, auto-labeling, preprocessing, training, and LoRA merging.
